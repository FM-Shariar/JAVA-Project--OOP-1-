The Shop Dealership Management System is a Java-based application developed with Java Swing, designed to streamline shop dealership operations.<br>

 It accommodates two user types: normal users and administrators. Normal users can easily register, log in, manage their profiles, browse available shops, view shop details, and make purchases. Administrators, on the other hand, have control over user and shop management, including adding, deleting, and updating user and shop information. The system ensures data security, features an intuitive Java Swing user interface, and integrates with a database for seamless data management.<br>
